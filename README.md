# Giovanni Turchetto's Web Developer Portfolio
Welcome to my <strong>web development</strong> and &#60;coding&#62; journey! This is my special place where I show off the <em>cool websites</em> I've built and all the nerdy stuff I do to make them work.

This portfolio is like a <strong>personal showcase of my web projects</strong>! Imagine you're on a quest to make an <em>awesome website or app</em>. This is the right place where you can see if I'm the sidekick you need. See you!
